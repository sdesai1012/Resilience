    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about inspiring others to live purpose-driven lives. I grew up in India before my family moved to the U.S. when I was a teenager, and ever since, my journey has been about adapting to new environments and embracing growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With over 12 years of experience as an auditor across the U.S., Ireland, and Sweden, I’ve come to understand the realities and demands of high-pressure environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      A decade ago, I found myself physically and mentally out of shape—disconnected from who I really was. That discomfort sparked a personal transformation. I began the process of getting back in touch with my values and started building a life that truly aligns with them. My path has taken me across continents—from moving to new countries and pushing myself in endurance races to exploring mountains as a way to reconnect with myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I’m in Thailand, immersing myself in Muay Thai training—a continuation of my journey of self-discovery through movement, discipline, and intentional living.

    <h2>Why the name Caramel Viking?</h2>
    <p>
      Caramel Viking represents the fusion of strength and sensitivity—a balance of fire and calm. The name was born unexpectedly while I was taking a cold plunge in Åre, Sweden, when someone shouted, “Caramel Viking!” and it stuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Caramel” reflects my Indian roots, while “Viking” symbolizes the inner resilience I forged during my time in Sweden. It’s a unique blend of warmth and grit—about embracing life’s challenges with courage and determination while staying grounded in who you truly are.
